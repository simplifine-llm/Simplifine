    Send a training query to the server endpoint.

    This function sends a POST request with the provided query data to a predefined
    server endpoint and returns the server's JSON response. If an error occurs during
    the request, it returns an error message.

    Parameters:
    -----------
    query : dict, optional
        The query data to be sent to the server. Default is an empty dictionary.

    Returns:
    --------
    response_data : dict
        The JSON response from the server, if the request is successful.
        In case of an error, a dictionary containing the error message.

    Raises:
    -------
    requests.exceptions.RequestException
        If an error occurs during the HTTP request, such as connection issues or
        invalid responses.

    Examples:
    ---------
    Example usage of the function:

    >>> query_data = {"param1": "value1", "param2": "value2"}
    >>> response = send_train_query(query_data)
    >>> print(response)
    {'result': 'success', 'data': {...}}
